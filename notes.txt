Postgresql notes.
* used CASCADE in drop table drivers CASCADE; to drop tables with foreign key. 
* sql statements in seed were not running because I wasn't terminating each statement with semicolon. 
* created sequilize file so I can setup database once and use it in controller files. 

Server Notes
* used console.log on request body to see what are the properties of request object. so I can insert correct values. 
* I started using request, response variable names instead of req, res becouse it's more descriptive

Client Notes
  - Javascript
    * issue: body is undefined
    * solution: didn't declare variable body, instead I passed vehicle object. and problem solved.  
  - HTML
    * used required attribute on inputs to validate form. 
  - CSS
    * drivers cards were overlapping over form, used flex-flow: wrap to solve this issue.
